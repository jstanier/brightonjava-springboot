=======================

Demo of Spring Boot at Brighton Java, 10th November 2014. In the demo I showed the following things:

* Creating a quick Spring project backed by MongoDB using [Spring Initialzr](http://start.spring.io/)
* Using [Spring Actuator](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready) to view a number of information endpoints you can use out of the box
* Writing a custom [health indicator](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-health) for Spring Actuator
* Using the [Spring CLI](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#cli) interface for finding out information about the webapp
* Using [RestRepositories](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-rest/) to quickly get access to our data
* Creating an endpoint to put data into our webapp

The rough structure of this live demo was borrowed from [Josh Long](http://spring.io/team/jlong) who did a better job than me, so thanks Josh.
